HERCULES FOR WIN64 README FILE

There are two 64-bit architectures supported by 64-bit Windows:
- x64 also known as x86_64 (for AMD64 and Intel EM64T processors)
- ia64 (for Intel Itanium processors)

This document covers only the x64 architecture.

HOW TO COMPILE HERCULES FOR AMD64

1. Install Visual C++ 2010 Express from the Visual Studio 2010 Express page:
   http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express

2. Install Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1 from:
   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
   IMPORTANT: select all components *except* the Visual C++ Compilers

3. Install Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Compiler Update for the Windows SDK 7.1 from:
   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422

4. Go to the start menu and choose "All Programs"
   - "Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1" - "Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1 Command Prompt"

5. If you require gzip or bzip2 for disk or tape compression, or if you
   require PCRE for the Hercules Automatic Operator facility, you should
   install the AMD64 versions of these programs in winbuild\zlib\x64
   winbuild\bzip2\x64 and winbuild\pcre\x64 under the Hercules directory. 
   You may override these default directory locations by setting
   environment variables, for example:
   SET ZLIB_DIR=c:\packages\zlib
   SET BZIP2_DIR=c:\packages\bzip2
   SET PCRE_DIR=c:\packages\pcre

6. nmake -f makefile-dllmod.msvc clean
   nmake -f makefile-dllmod.msvc

7. The binaries will be installed into subfolder "msvc.AMD64.bin"
   If you compiled on a 32-bit Windows system, copy this folder
   to your target 64-bit Windows machine.

8. If you copy the binaries to a machine which does not have Visual
   Studio 2010 (VS10) installed, then you must also install the
   Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64)
   on the target machine. This package can be downloaded from
   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632
